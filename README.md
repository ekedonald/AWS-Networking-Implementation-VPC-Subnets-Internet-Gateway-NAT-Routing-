# AWS Networking Implementation (VPC, Subnets, Interet Gateway, NAT & Routing)

## What Is an Amazon VPC?
An Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is like your own private section of the Amazon cloud where you can place and manage resources (i.e. servers or databases). You control incoming and outfoing traffic like a gated community.

### The Default VPC
The default VPC is like a starter pack provided by amazon for your cloud resources. It is a pre-configured space in the Amazon cloud where you can immediately start deploying your apllications or services. It has built-in-security and network settings to help you get up and running quickly but you can adjust these as you see fit.

A Default VPC which Amazon provides for you in each region (think of a region as a separate city) is like a pre-built house in that city. This house comes with some defaukt settings to help you move in and start living (or start deploying your applications) immediately but juat like a real house, you can change these settings according to your needs.

### Creating & Configuring Subnets
#### What are Subnets?
Subnets are like smaller segments within a VPC that help you organize and manage your resources. Subnets are like dividing an office building into smaller sections, where each section represents a department. In this analogy, subents are created to organize and manage the network effectively.
